First of all, thank you for visiting my blog. And also, thank you for reading a post that you're probably not going to get much out of.

I create content all the time, whether it's a fantasy football model or my research on the latest piece of technology or just random thoughts and ideas that pop into my head. I could just collect it in plain text files or spreadsheets on my computer, but then no one else could benefit from it. I could post it in some forum or subreddit, but then my content would be scattered and hard to find again. I could set up a Tumblr or WordPress blog, but I want to have full control over my content and I want things to be simple.

Which leads me to this blog.

I've chosen a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-powered blog hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because it fulfills all of my needs. I get to collect all of my content in one, easy-to-find place, I get to store it in plain text on my computer and not in some database, and I get version control and hosting for free. I won't go into detail about how I set this blog up because the Jekyll and Github Pages documentation is great and [this post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) filled in the gaps.

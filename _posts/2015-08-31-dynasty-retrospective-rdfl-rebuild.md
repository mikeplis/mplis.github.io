title: A Dynasty Retrospective - Mid-Rebuild
---

I've been in the middle of a long-term rebuild as a part of the 72-team Reddit Dynasty League (RDFL) and I wanted to offer my commentary on the moves that I've made since I took control of an orphaned team following the 2013-2014 season.

Important League Parameters
---

* Starting Roster
  * 1 QB
  * 2-4 RB
  * 2-4 WR

*Note: This league is technically an IDP league, but I'm basically going to ignore IDP in this post. I almost never carry IDP during the offseason since we have so few defensive starters.*


Team Draft
---

When teams are orphaned in RDFL, they are distributed to new owners in a draft. The year that I joined, there were 17 orphaned teams and I was given the 11th pick. You can check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFootballLeague/comments/1wb55a/official_reddit_new_ownership_draft/) post on Reddit for tons of info about that draft. After ([too](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dSOtW1l_CCMVZdty0tuDyivNlPSiJzWGvZ5jSPvUWMw/edit#gid=0)) much deliberation, I decided to take over the Switzerland Gnomes of Zurich (and then promptly renamed them).

Roster - Original
---

QB - Rivers, Ryan

RB - Lynch, Moreno, Jones-Drew, Bradshaw, Shonn Greene, Daryl Richardson, Goodson

WR - Cruz, K Wright, Shorts, E Sanders, Boldin, Stevie Johnson, Kerley, Mike Brown, Marlon Brown, Mike Williams

TE - Graham, Clay, Lewis

Well, went you get to choose the 11th-best abandoned team, this is what you get. It wasn't pretty, but there were some pieces to work with. At the time, Graham was a top-10 startup pick [according to DLF](http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/rankings/adp-february-2014/). Matt Ryan was the QB9, Cruz was the WR20, and Lynch was the RB11. I definitely didn't think there was enough to make a run with this team, so I committed to a rebuild early on.

2014 Offseason
---

I worked quickly to trade away any aging players that still had some value in exchange for young players and draft picks.

**Traded Marshawn Lynch, Kendall Wright for Keenan Allen, 1.05**

I valued Wright pretty highly and I wasn't crazy about parting with him, but I was very motivated to move Lynch since I felt his value was at its peak, which I believe was true. Unfortunately, I paid for another player whose value had reached a peak: Keenan Allen. Allen's value may eventually get back to where it was last year ([top-10 dynasty WR](http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/rankings/adp-march-2014/)), but that was certainly not the time to buy him.

**Traded Knowshon Moreno for 2.09**

I made this trade the day that Moreno signed with Miami. He was another guy I was very motivated to move since he was older and was coming off his great season in Denver that felt a little fluky.

**Traded Philip Rivers, 3.07 for 2.05, Geno Smith**

The 2.05 was my target in this deal and Geno was just a throw-in so that I wasn't stuck with only 1 QB on my roster. Rivers is a decent QB, but I felt that we had seen his ceiling and this is a 1 QB league anyway.

**Traded 1.05, 1.07, 3.03, Marlon Brown for DeAndre Hopkins, 2.06**

This was definitely my biggest trade of the offseason and I caught a lot of flak for it. A lot of people said that I overpaid for Hopkins, who was ranked as the WR18 at the time. Recently, I went back and tried to guess who I would've taken with those first round picks. My memory isn't perfect, but I'm pretty sure I would've ended up with Sankey and Davante Adams. That did make me feel a little bit better about the trade, but ultimately, I think that I overpaid based on Hopkins' value at the time. I was so thrilled to find an owner that was willing to part with a young, talented WR like Hopkins that I jumped on the first deal that looked okay.

**Traded Emmanuel Sanders, Maurice Jones-Drew, Jermichael Finley, 2.06 for TY Hilton**

I was trying to capitalize on the hype Emmanuel Sanders was getting after he signed in Denver. This trade happened in May and, to my dismay, the hype only continued to grow through the preseason and regular season. Thankfully, Jones-Drew and Finley quickly became droppable and Hilton's value got a nice bump as he was able to prove that he can be a legitimate fantasy WR1.

[2014 Rookie Draft](http://football26.myfantasyleague.com/2014/options?L=17492&O=17&DISPLAY=DIVISION02&POSITION=*&FRANCHISE=0000)
---

Those trades comprised most of my activity leading up to the 2014 rookie draft, which in this league is held in mid-August. Since I had very little talent on my roster, I was content to take who fell to me.

**2.05 - Donte Moncrief**

My comment on this pick was "Pretty raw but he's got the look of a future #1 WR and has a great QB.". From what I remember, he was the only guy I considered at this spot. I definitely wanted to build up my WR corps and he was head and shoulders above the rest of the WR's left on the board.

**2.07 - Charles Sims**

"Great talent in a tough situation. Has a chance to see the field this season as a change-of-pace back, but I'm hoping he carves out a bigger role within a year or two". I wasn't a huge fan of any of the WR's left at this spot and I had a huge need at RB. I was really struggling to decide between Sims, Ka'Deem Carey, and Tre Mason. Since I was thinking long-term, I took the guy I felt was the best talent.

**Traded Stevie Johnson, 2.09 for Rod Streater, 3.05, 2015 3rd**

This is probably the worst trade I've made since taking over this team. Thankfully, it wasn't the kind of trade that can completely sink your team. I thought that Johnson was washed up and that Streater had breakout potential in Oakland.

**3.05 - Ka'Deem Carey**

"I was considering him at 2.07 so I'll happily scoop him up here". I was pretty stoked to see Carey fall to this spot. This was another pick I made with my eye a few years down the road and I was content to stash Carey until Forte was out of the way.

**4.07 - C.J. Fiedorowicz**

I still had Graham, but didn't have much depth behind him. At this point, I didn't know a ton about any of the players left, so I pretty much just took a shot in the dark.

Roster - After 2014 Rookie Draft
---

QB - Ryan, Flacco, G Smith, Glennon

RB - Sims, Carey, Bradshaw, D Robinson, Shonn Greene, Dunbar, Riddick

WR - Hopkins, Allen, Hilton, Cruz, Shorts, Streater, Malcom Floyd, Hawkins, Austin

TE - Graham, Clay, Fiedorowicz, Toilolo

So far so good. Most of my older players that had any value were gone, I had acquired a couple of good, young WR's to build around, and I had picked up a few guys I liked off of waivers like Robinson, Riddick, and Hawkins. I would have liked to have moved Graham at his first round startup price, but I figured I'd eventually find a buyer. 

[2014-2015 Season](http://football26.myfantasyleague.com/2014/options?L=17492&O=16&F=0020)
---

I definitely didn't see my team as a contender, especially with those RB's. And even if I did, Hilton got off to a slow start, Allen had a rough season, and Cruz got hurt. Bradshaw was usable, but since he obviously wasn't in my long-term plans, I moved him for a 2016 3rd.

Now I'm going to say something that may rub some people the wrong way: I intentionally tanked this season. Once it was clear I couldn't make the playoffs, I dropped my IDP and kicker, used the extra roster spots on offensive sleepers, and tanked my way to the 1.01. I'm not exactly proud of what I did, but I didn't do anything that was against the league bylaws and I've always felt that if a commissioner truly wants to eliminate tanking, they should write the bylaws in a way that prevents it.

2015 Offseason
---

I didn't make many moves during the season, so I went into the 2015 offseason with pretty much the same roster that I had at the beginning of the season. Despite my focus on getting younger, a few of my early offseason trades saw me move draft picks for players that I coveted.

**Traded 3.01 for Paul Richardson**

**Traded 2.01 for Kenny Stills**

Richardson and Stills were two of my favorite sleepers, but I think I was a bit premature with these trades. I liked both of them until Miami drafted DeVante Parker and Seattle drafted Tyler Lockett. I think I could have gotten a better deal if I had waited until after the NFL Draft, when the value of Richardson and Stills had fallen and the value of my draft picks had risen.

**Traded 3.03 for Jason Witten, Gavin Escobar**

This was offered to me and I took it solely on value. I figured I could eventually move Witten for something and Escobar was a good, young TE to have on my roster.

**Traded Charles Sims, Cecil Shorts for Brian Quick, 3.09**

I liked Quick as a bounce-back candidate and made him a target of mine. I didn't think that Shorts would ever become a usable fantasy asset, so I had no problem parting with him. I still believed in Sims' upside, but I just liked Quick a lot more.

**Traded Jimmy Graham for 1.02**

I finally got a deal done for Graham. I definitely could've gotten more for him last offseason, but unfortunately I couldn't find a serious buyer. Despite being traded to Seattle, he still has a lot of value. He is already 28 though and I believe that by the time my team is ready to compete, Graham will have lost a lot of value.

**Traded 1.02 for 1.03, 1.10**

The thought of adding both Cooper and Gurley to my roster was very appealing, but I thought this was a good value so I took the trade. I definitely needed depth and knew I'd still be able to get a really good player at 1.03.

Roster - Before 2015 Rookie Draft
---

QB - Ryan, Flacco, G Smith

RB - D Robinson, Dunbar, Riddick, Cadet

WR - Hopkins, Hilton, Allen, Moncrief, Cruz, Stills, Quick, Beasley, B Coleman, A Wilson, M Brown, P Richardson, Aiken

TE - Witten, Clay, Escobar, Cook, Paul

Picks - 1.01, 1.03, 1.10, 3.08, 3.09, 4.07

[2015 Rookie Draft](http://football26.myfantasyleague.com/2015/options?L=34348&O=17&DISPLAY=DIVISION02)
---

I was very active during the 2015 rookie draft. I went in with a bunch of picks and I had a few players I was hoping to move.

**1.01 - Amari Cooper**

I knew I was likely only going to get one of Cooper or Gurley. It was a tough choice between those two, but ultimately I went with Cooper because he is a WR and you can never have too many WR's.

**1.03 - DeVante Parker**

Remember when I said you could never have too many WR's? I did consider Gordon here, but I truly thought that Parker was the best player available. Ideally, I would have traded down to the 1.04, but the owner wasn't interested, so I stuck to my guns and picked the guy I wanted.

**Traded Victor Cruz for 2.11, 3.11**

This may have been a slight undersell, but I really wanted to trade Cruz. He still has some upside, but he's going into his age-29 season, he's coming off a bad injury, and he won't see the same volume of targets he used to now that Odell Beckham Jr. is around.

**1.10 - Dorial Green-Beckham**

I'm not the biggest fan of Green-Beckham, but after taking Cooper and Parker, I was more okay with taking a chance on his upside. I would have preferred any of Yeldon, Abdullah, Agholor, and Perriman here, but unfortunately they were all gone, and I didn't think the difference in value was big enough that it was worth it to try to move up.

**Traded Matt Ryan, 4.07 for Nick Foles, 2.05, 3.04**

**2.05 - Phillip Dorsett**

The owner of the 2.05 was interested in trading the pick and I thought Dorsett was a good value at that spot, so we started to negotiate a deal. He expressed interest in Matt Ryan, who I had no problem parting with in a 1 QB league. I already owned Hilton and Moncrief, but I liked Dorsett's talent and figured that if there was any WR corps to lock down for the foreseeable future, it would be the one catching passes from Andrew Luck.

**Traded Jason Witten for 3.07**

Witten is one of my all-time favorite NFL players, but he had very little value to my fantasy team. I had been having a hard time trading him, so once another owner expressed interest in acquiring a veteran TE, I acted quickly to get a deal done.

**2.11 - Jameis Winston**

I wasn't originally planning on taking a QB in this draft, but I thought Winston was a really good value here and I had room for a young QB after trading away Matt Ryan. Mariota was also available and I wrestled with which QB to take, but I ultimately settled on the guy I thought had the highest upside.

**Traded 3.09, 3.11 for 3.03**

It was around this time that I realized I had too many draft picks. I knew that I was eventually going to have to drop 6 players in order to pick up the 4 IDP's, 1 kicker, and 1 coach I needed to fill out my starting roster and I didn't want to be stuck having to drop a guy I just drafted, so I made this trade to consolidate some of my picks.

**3.03 - Devin Smith**

**3.04 - Cameron Artis-Payne**

**3.07 - Chris Conley**

**3.08 - Josh Robinson**

I liked the upside of both Smith and Conley and felt that they both had a decent chance to see the field in their rookie years, which I think is important for mid/late-round rookies. I'm only willing to hold onto average talents for so long and the sooner I can figure out if they're legitimate NFL players, the better.

I wasn't super crazy about Artis-Payne or Robinson, but my RB corps really needed an injection of youth and I didn't like any of the WR's left on the board.

**4.06 - MyCole Pruitt**

Pruitt is one of my favorite late round rookies. He had a very productive college career and only has Kyle "This Will Finally Be His Breakout Season" Rudolph ahead of him.

[Roster - Current](http://football26.myfantasyleague.com/2015/options?L=34348&O=07&F=0020)
---

QB - Winston, Flacco, Foles

RB - Artis-Payne, J Robinson, D Robinson, Dunbar, Riddick, Cadet

WR - Hopkins, Cooper, Hilton, Allen, Parker, Green-Beckham, Dorsett, Moncrief, Stills, Quick, Conley, D Smith, Beasley, B Coleman, A Wilson, M Brown, P Richardson, Aiken

TE - Clay, Cook, Escobar, Paul

**Here's my original roster again for comparison:**

QB - Rivers, Ryan

RB - Lynch, Moreno, Jones-Drew, Bradshaw, Shonn Greene, Daryl Richardson, Goodson

WR - Cruz, K Wright, Shorts, E Sanders, Boldin, Stevie Johnson, Kerley, Mike Brown, Marlon Brown, Mike Williams

TE - Graham, Clay, Lewis

I'm very happy with how my rebuild is going so far. I certainly don't have a contender yet, but I have a ton of young WR's that will hopefully develop into usable fantasy assets that I can eventually trade away to upgrade my other positions. Overall, my current team is much more fun to own than my original team and I'm very excited about the direction it's headed.

Lessons Learned
---

* **If you're motivated to move a player, get a deal done.** Don't be so concerned with squeezing every last bit of value out of him. You may have to accept less than the "market value", but it's important to realize that market value differs from league to league. A fantasy league isn't like a stock market - there are only a few potential buyers.
* **When evaluating your past trades, be process-driven, not results-driven.** The Hopkins trade may look okay now knowing who I would've taken with those first round picks, but that doesn't mean it was a good trade. I should have waited until closer to the rookie draft to trade those picks away.
* **Avoid trading for veterans before the NFL Draft**. Veterans rarely gain much value after the draft, but they can lose a ton of it. I liked Paul Richardson and Kenny Stills and likely could have gotten them for cheaper than I did had I waited until after the NFL Draft to trade for them.
* **Have fun.** This sounds corny, but it's huge for me, especially with a relatively low-stakes dynasty team. Lately, I'm finding myself moving more towards DFS and best ball leagues and away from the more high-maintenance, low-ROI redraft and dynasty leagues. However, this league is still my favorite and I think that's because I'm having a lot of fun rebuilding this team. If you don't enjoy owning a team, mix things up. Trade for a stud WR you really want to own. Blow your team up and rebuild. Do something to make it fun to own that team.

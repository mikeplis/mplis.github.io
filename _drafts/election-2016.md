title: Election 2016

----

I've spent a lot of time following the presidential election this past year. I think it's important for people to vote and I also think it's important to be as informed as possible. I believe that part of being informed is simply talking to your friends and family about the candidates. 

I want to emphasize that the purpose of this post isn't to tell you how to vote. I simply want to explain why I'm voting the way I am. For those that have already made up their minds, I hope that you'll come away with an understanding of how I'm approaching this election and what's important to me. For those that haven't, 

I hope that you'll take the time to read the whole thing and maintain an open mind. 



I've spent a lot of time thinking about this election and it was difficult for me to explain exactly why Donald Trump is such an unsatisfactory candidate to me. But then I realized why it was so difficult.

In past elections, I've voted for the candidate whose policies I agreed with the most, and I had assumed I was approaching this election the same way. But that didn't explain why I found Trump *so* objectionable.

I realized that the reason I was so dissatisfied with Trump is that he fails a simple test, one that I never even realized I administered to candidates because no one's ever come close to failing it before. It's not an explicit test, but if I could best summarize it, it would be this question: "Does this candidate have the capability to completely fuck everything up?".

Now I don't really know what it means to "fuck everything up" and I don't think the chance that Trump does is all that high, but it's above zero and that's the point.

Trump does not have the temperment I want in a President and I think the debates were a clear example of that.

I used to think the debates were kind of pointless, that none of the questions ever got answered and that you never really learned anything from them. I always wanted a debate where the candidates were put through the ringer ([like on that episode of The Newsroom](https://youtu.be/AF-BZsrtoPs?t=141)).


If you watched the debates this year, you probably noticed a similar pattern in each of them. At the beginning of the debates, Trump held his own. He hit his talking points, gave coherent answers, and was generally under control. But in each debate, there came a point around 30 minutes in that he started to unravel.

* Backwards ideas about non-whites and women

I used to hold the opinion that it wasn't worth spending a lot of time learning about candidates in the national election. I felt that if I was going to pay attention to the election, I would *really* want to pay attention and learn as much as I could about the candidates, but since I only had one vote, that seemed like a lot of work in order to make an extremely small impact on the election.

But I've come to realize that I can make a bigger impact that I originally thought. I can voice my opinions and potentially affect the vote of my friends and family, who could then affect the votes of other people. So over the last several months, I've *really* been paying attention to the national election. With only a couple months to go until Election Day, I felt that now was the right time for me to start trying to make an impact.

I'm writing this post because I will not wake up on November 9th to a Trump victory and say to myself "I wish I had done more". [Unlike Donald Trump](http://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13153832/donald-trump-refuse-to-concede), I will accept the results of the election even if they don't go the way I want them to, but I will do whatever little bit I can before the election to prevent him from winning.

Writing this post was hard. Not because it was hard to come up with reasons why Donald Trump is an unacceptable (?) choice for President (that part was painfully easy). The hard part was trying to

In the past, I never spent much time following the presidential elections. I felt that my one vote didn't make much of an impact, so I never felt that putting in the work to be an informed voter was worth the effort. But I came to the realization that I didn't just have influence over my

I hope that everyone can read this post with an open mind. I'm going to do my best to express why *I'm* voting for or against a particular candidate and I understand that not everyone has the same priorities that I do. Despite what some people are saying, there is no objectively right or wrong choice in this election and I commend people that take the time to thoughtfully consider many points of view.

I won't bury the lede any longer: On November 8th, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton for president. My vote is more of a vote against Trump than it is a vote for Clinton, but that doesn't mean I don't think Hillary Clinton will make a good president.

On a scale from 0-10, where 0 means I have an extremely unfavorable view of a candidate, 10 means an extremely favorable view of them, and a 5 is a neutral view, Clinton is about a 6.

That's obviously not ideal and I have my issues with her as a candidate, but overall it does fall on the "favorable" side of the spectrum. What makes this election such an easy decision for me is that Donald Trump is a hard 0. I can't imagine a presidential candidate that I would dislike more, and I think I have a pretty vivid imagination.

I don't consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. I vote based on what I think is best for the country. There were several candidates in the Republican primary that I would have given strong consideration to.

##The Case Against Donald Trump##

It wasn't easy keeping this part of my post to a reasonable length. 

###He's Wrong...A Lot

When Donald Trump is wrong about something, it's often very difficult to tell if he's being deliberately misleading or is just thoroughly misinformed. The number of times he's been wrong about something is staggering.

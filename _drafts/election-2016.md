Hey Uncle Steven,

Sarah and I really enjoyed having Matt over as well.

I appreciate you taking the time to write up your thoughts so that I could see things from your perspective. It doesn't seem like you're a huge fan of Trump, but you feel that there's a better chance of the policies you think are important being implemented in a Trump presidency than a Clinton one. That's perfectly reasonable.

I tend to lean liberal on a few issues, likely due to the fact that I didn't start paying much attention to politics until I went to Penn, but I don't consider myself to be a partisan. I think I would have given serious consideration to pretty much any other Republican candidate (except probably Cruz).

Having said that, there was never a chance I was going to vote for Trump this election. I can't imagine a more objectionable candidate winning a presidential nomination, and I think I have a pretty vivid imagination.

Trying to figure out why exactly I find Trump so unacceptable has not been easy, since there are so many things that have contributed to my unusually low opinion of him. But I think the best encapsulation of why I'm not voting for Trump is that I think he's an extremely dangerous candidate.

This election has unfortunately never been about policy for me because of the potential damage that I believe Trump is capable of inflicting on this country and the world regardless of what policies are.

First, I have concerns about him being in control of our nuclear weapons. He's displayed an [alarmingly cavalier attitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxujhzt9FTk) towards nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation. He claims that nuclear proliferation is the greatest threat to the world, yet [doesn't seem to know some of the basic principles of our country's nuclear policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq6UtGcGPLM).

He's also not shown the temperament of someone that should be in control of nuclear weapons. He's easily baited and has a very difficult time overlooking any slight or insult thrown his way, which was evident [in each](https://newrepublic.com/article/137222/clinton-proved-trump-man-can-bait-debate) of his [three debates](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-first-debate-fights-228710) against Hillary Clinton, or during [his public feud](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/politics/donald-trump-khizr-khan-wife-ghazala.html) with the Khan's, a Muslim-American family whose son was killed while serving in Iraq.

I'm extremely grateful that I've never had to live under the realistic threat of nuclear war. I hope that I never have to.

Next, Trump is undermining some of the foundations of our democracy. His repeated insistence, without offering a shred of evidence, that the election is going to be [rigged against him](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-large-scale-voter-f/) is one of the most irresponsible things a presidential candidate has ever done. He's [refused to commit](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/will-trump-accept-election-results-2016-debate-230038) to accepting the results of the election, threatening one of the most important traditions in our political system and sowing the seeds for potential unrest and even violence in the aftermath of the election.

Also, Trump has energized some of the most (dare I say) deplorable factions of this country and has inflamed some of America's most vile impulses. He has the support of various [white-nationalist groups](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-2016-white-nationalists-alt-right-214388) such as the KKK and the American Nazi Party. Not only does he have the support of white supremacists, it seems [he's used his Twitter account to court their support as well](http://fortune.com/donald-trump-white-supremacist-genocide/).

He's stoked racial tensions and offended nearly every minority group in this country. He's suggested than an American judge couldn't do his job properly simply because of his Mexican heritage, which even Paul Ryan thought was the ["textbook definition of a racist comment"](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/paul-ryan-trump-judge-223991). He [started, lead, and (only recently) sort of ended the birther movement](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/trump-birther/500327/), which sought to delegitimize our country's first African-American president.

Electing Donald Trump would be telling this country that this kind of behavior is not only tolerable, but can be used to propel you to even the most important job in the country.

Trump has the potential to create problems that are far worse than the ones we currently face, while not doing anything to solve the ones we have now. He has no public service experience and has shown little interest in the legislative responsibilities of the presidency. He takes every problem in this country (real or imagined), exaggerates them, lays them solely at the feet of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and offers few actual solutions of his own.

My objections to Trump could go on much longer. I haven't even touched on his [authoritarian tendencies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/07/a-final-plea-the-case-against-trumps-dangerous-authoritarianism-in-one-chart/), the tape where he was caught [bragging about sexually assaulting women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html), or his [general habit of just making shit up and hoping no one bothers to check if he's lying](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/oct/27/donald-trumps-top-10-most-misleading-claims/).

I truly understand that your choice this election has not been easy, but I simply can't empathize with you on this one. I'm confident that this will be one of the easiest votes I'll ever cast.

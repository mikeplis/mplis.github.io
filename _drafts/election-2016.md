title: Election 2016
---

I used to hold the opinion that it wasn't worth spending a lot of time learning about candidates in the national election. I felt that if I was going to pay attention to the election, I would *really* want to pay attention and learn as much as I could about the candidates, but since I only had one vote, that seemed like a lot of work in order to make an extremely small impact on the election.

But I've come to realize that I can make a bigger impact that I originally thought. I can voice my opinions and potentially affect the vote of my friends and family, who could then affect the votes of other people. So over the last several months, I've *really* been paying attention to the national election. With only a couple months to go until Election Day, I felt that now was the right time for me to start trying to make an impact.

I'm writing this post because I will not wake up on November 9th to a Trump victory and say to myself "I wish I had done more". [Unlike Donald Trump](http://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13153832/donald-trump-refuse-to-concede), I will accept the results of the election even if they don't go the way I want them to, but I will do whatever little bit I can before the election to prevent him from winning.

Writing this post was hard. Not because it was hard to come up with reasons why Donald Trump is an unacceptable (?) choice for President (that part was painfully easy). The hard part was trying to

In the past, I never spent much time following the presidential elections. I felt that my one vote didn't make much of an impact, so I never felt that putting in the work to be an informed voter was worth the effort. But I came to the realization that I didn't just have influence over my

I hope that everyone can read this post with an open mind. I'm going to do my best to express why *I'm* voting for or against a particular candidate and I understand that not everyone has the same priorities that I do. Despite what some people are saying, there is no objectively right or wrong choice in this election and I commend people that take the time to thoughtfully consider many points of view.

I won't bury the lede any longer: On November 8th, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton for president. My vote is more of a vote against Trump than it is a vote for Clinton, but that doesn't mean I don't think Hillary Clinton will make a good president.

On a scale from 0-10, where 0 means I have an extremely unfavorable view of a candidate, 10 means an extremely favorable view of them, and a 5 is a neutral view, Clinton is about a 6.

That's obviously not ideal and I have my issues with her as a candidate, but overall it does fall on the "favorable" side of the spectrum. What makes this election such an easy decision for me is that Donald Trump is a hard 0. I can't imagine a presidential candidate that I would dislike more, and I think I have a pretty vivid imagination.

I don't consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. I vote based on what I think is best for the country. There were several candidates in the Republican primary that I would have given strong consideration to.

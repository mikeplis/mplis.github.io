title: Election 2016
---

----

I've spent a lot of time following the presidential election this past year. I think it's important for people to vote and I also think it's important to be as informed as possible. I believe that part of being informed is simply talking to your friends and family about the candidates. 

I want to emphasize that the purpose of this post isn't to tell you how to vote. I simply want to explain why I'm voting the way I am. For those that have already made up their minds, I hope that you'll come away with an understanding of how I'm approaching this election and what's important to me. For those that haven't, 

I hope that you'll take the time to read the whole thing and maintain an open mind. 


I've spent a lot of time thinking about this election and it was difficult for me to explain exactly why Donald Trump is such an unsatisfactory candidate to me. But then I realized why it was so difficult.

In past elections, I've voted for the candidate whose policies I agreed with the most, and I had assumed I was approaching this election the same way. But that didn't explain why I found Trump *so* objectionable.

I realized that the reason I was so dissatisfied with Trump is that he fails a simple test, one that I never even realized I administered to candidates because no one's ever come close to failing it before. It's not an explicit test, but if I could best summarize it, it would be this question: "Does this candidate have the capability to completely fuck everything up?".

Now I don't really know what it means to "fuck everything up" and I don't think the chance that Trump does is all that high, but it's above zero and that's the point.

Trump does not have the temperment I want in a President and I think the debates were a clear example of that.

I used to think the debates were kind of pointless, that none of the questions ever got answered and that you never really learned anything from them. I always wanted a debate where the candidates were put through the ringer ([like on that episode of The Newsroom](https://youtu.be/AF-BZsrtoPs?t=141)).


If you watched the debates this year, you probably noticed a similar pattern in each of them. At the beginning of the debates, Trump held his own. He hit his talking points, gave coherent answers, and was generally under control. But in each debate, there came a point around 30 minutes in that he started to unravel. 

* Authoritarian tendencies
* Backwards ideas about non-whites and women

I used to hold the opinion that it wasn't worth spending a lot of time learning about candidates in the national election. I felt that if I was going to pay attention to the election, I would *really* want to pay attention and learn as much as I could about the candidates, but since I only had one vote, that seemed like a lot of work in order to make an extremely small impact on the election.

But I've come to realize that I can make a bigger impact that I originally thought. I can voice my opinions and potentially affect the vote of my friends and family, who could then affect the votes of other people. So over the last several months, I've *really* been paying attention to the national election. With only a couple months to go until Election Day, I felt that now was the right time for me to start trying to make an impact.

I'm writing this post because I will not wake up on November 9th to a Trump victory and say to myself "I wish I had done more". [Unlike Donald Trump](http://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13153832/donald-trump-refuse-to-concede), I will accept the results of the election even if they don't go the way I want them to, but I will do whatever little bit I can before the election to prevent him from winning.

Writing this post was hard. Not because it was hard to come up with reasons why Donald Trump is an unacceptable (?) choice for President (that part was painfully easy). The hard part was trying to

In the past, I never spent much time following the presidential elections. I felt that my one vote didn't make much of an impact, so I never felt that putting in the work to be an informed voter was worth the effort. But I came to the realization that I didn't just have influence over my

----

I hope that everyone can read this post with an open mind. I'm going to do my best to express why *I'm* voting for or against a particular candidate and I understand that not everyone has the same priorities that I do. Despite what some people are saying, there is no objectively right or wrong choice in this election and I commend people that take the time to thoughtfully consider many points of view.

----

I won't bury the lede any longer: On November 8th, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton for president. My vote is more of a vote against Trump than it is a vote for Clinton, but that doesn't mean I don't think Hillary Clinton will make a good president.

On a scale from 0-10, where 0 means I have an extremely unfavorable view of a candidate, 10 means an extremely favorable view of them, and a 5 is a neutral view, Clinton is about a 6.

That's obviously not ideal and I have my issues with her as a candidate, but overall it does fall on the "favorable" side of the spectrum. What makes this election such an easy decision for me is that Donald Trump is a hard 0. I can't imagine a presidential candidate that I would dislike more, and I think I have a pretty vivid imagination.

----

I don't consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. I vote based on what I think is best for the country. There were several candidates in the Republican primary that I would have given strong consideration to.

It wasn't easy keeping this part of my post to a reasonable length.

When Donald Trump is wrong about something, it's often very difficult to tell if he's being deliberately misleading or is just thoroughly misinformed. The number of times he's been wrong about something is staggering.

Hey Uncle Steven,

Sarah and I really enjoyed having Matt over as well.

I appreciate you taking the time to write up your thoughts so that I could see things from your perspective. It doesn't seem like you're a huge fan of Trump, but you feel that there's a better chance of the policies you think are important being implemented in a Trump presidency than a Clinton one. That's perfectly reasonable.

I tend to lean liberal on a few issues, likely due to the fact that I didn't start paying much attention to politics until I went to Penn, but I don't consider myself to be a partisan. I think I would have given serious consideration to pretty much any other Republican candidate (except probably Cruz), and even more so if Sanders had won the Democratic nomination.

Having said that, there was never a chance I was going to vote for Trump this election. I can't imagine a more objectionable candidate winning a presidential nomination.




I see Trump as someone who woefully unqualified to handle the responsibilities of being President and is validating ideas and behaviors that are not only going to make solving the problems in this country much more difficult, but will also create bigger and more dangerous problems in the process.

It's often difficult to tell when Trump is being intentionally deceitful, or simply doesn't know what he's talking about.


Politicians have a reputation for lying, but Trump takes things to a new level. He literally makes things up, things that form the basis of his case to be President, and hopes people don't care enough to figure out if he's lying.

There are real issues to be tackled in this country, but it's impossible to actually work towards solving them when someone like Trump has no interest in honestly identifying what the problems are. He takes every problem in this country (real or imagined), exaggerates its effects, and lays them solely at the feet of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. That is the not the formula for a productive political discourse.




Trump's ties to authoritarianism and white supremacy are disqualifying. His repeated displays of sexism are disturbing. His fragile ego, lack of discipline, and propensity for inciting violence are concerning. His embrace of anti-intellectualism and conspiracy theorism is infuriating.

Trump has energized some of the most hateful and (dare I say) deplorable factions of this country that had previously been relegated to the fringes of society. He has inflamed some of this country's most dangerous and most vile impulses.

If Trump wins, it will have proven that even if you say a judge can't do his job properly because of his Mexican heritage, even if you mock a disabled reporter in front of thousands of people, even if you berate the family of a fallen Muslim-American soldier because they criticize you, even if you're caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women, none of it will matter because you can still become President of the United States.

Mike,

Hope all is well in NYC.  Matt enjoyed his evening with you and Sarah.  I think the chef will have to return the invite and whip something up at his house.  Know he is looking forward to the Thanksgiving invite.  Sounds like Sarah was able to make a job change with a better commute and what sounds like a more secure company. Congratulations to both of you.

Your mother shared with me your Facebook post.  First and foremost glad that you have an opinion and are voting. At this point the world belongs more to your generation than it does to mine. You and your contemporaries should have a prominent voice in shaping the future that belongs to you.  Honestly, little in the article that I disagree with except for the final conclusion that accrues from all of the facts outlined.  Maybe my own contorted mind games.

Must say I changed my vote almost daily over the past several months. This being said I ultimately checked the box for Donald this past week.  The number of things I don't agree with is long, his climate change position is certainly one and I am confident that both candidates are clueless on healthcare reform/finances.   The author clearly recognizes Hillary's transgressions but views them as less egregious.  Probably reasonable.

So why would I vote for Trump?  Ultimately I made the decision not based upon the candidates themselves but rather what I thought about the coat tails they would drag along. I watched a stump speech 10 days ago by Elizabeth Warren and that sealed the deal for me.  That she, and those who see the world like her, should have prominent positions in the Clinton presidency was simply too much for me to bear.  I don't disagree with some of the problems or issues raised by Bernie, and those of his mindset like Warren, are in need of solutions or attention.  Income inequality, social mobility, college debt, healthcare, and criminal justice reform to name a few are clearly legitimate concerns.  This being said I fundamentally disagree with their perspective on these topics.  For them, all are basically problems for the government to solve by spending money or transferring wealth.  I don't believe that they fundamentally agree with the concept of a meritocracy.  Rather, for them, what is most important is equality.  It's and old analogy but the example of the professor grading in this way is usually seen by most as not fair.  Never the less persons who support these politicians believe should run society in this way.  I would contend that most millennials that I have spoken to about this see this social justice as best for the society until the nitty gritty discussion of direct impact on their lives, like tax policy, is considered, then they want to protect their rightly earned gains.

The economic ills of stagnant wages, less upward mobility, mounting college debt, and escalating health care costs are real but the etiologies are multi-factorial and solutions can vary.  "Free" college?  Makes sense that college today is what high school was 50 years ago.  Tax me more to pay for it?  IDK.  What about making the system more efficient. I challenge you to calculate the inflation rate at U Penn over the past 30 years.  I suspect it rivals or exceeds that of healthcare and is far above that of the general economy. Why?  In no short reason because it's government funded almost w/o limit. Student loans can be had.  What about demanding accountability from the educational institutions.  Brick and mortar stuff like that should be obsolete or at least nearly so.  I can learn almost all of what I need to be an orthopedic surgeon on line or thru live interactive webinars that can reach hundreds or thousands at a time and that can be shared and re-reviewed.  Where is the economy of scale in the current system?  Why make it a tax payer problem?

The social commentary about criminal justice reform drives me crazy.  Do I think that there is "implicit bias?"  Sure.  This being said I think the Colin Kapernik protest and most of what "Black Lives Matter" stands for is BS.  I can not watch TV for 2 minutes w/o seeing people of color in positions that are important.  Almost all of the police chiefs at center of the controversies have been black.  Why is there never a discussion about personal accountability?   I think your father is a model of what is possible.  Opportunities were almost impossible to see.  That being said he somehow saw them, grasped them, and flourished.  Where is the discussion of personal responsibility within these communities when it comes to issues like single parent households--the greatest predictor of poverty.   I think we will all sink to a lower level if this primary historical tenet of American life is not preserved.

But I digress.  Is Donald the icon paragon of these ideals?  Hardly. But ultimately I convinced myself that the chance that these notions were more likely to embodied in a Supreme Court, in legislation enacted with Congress, and in a presidential administration were more likely with Donald than with Hillary.  Scary in many ways but that's how I chose.   The people will prevail in a few days and I guess history will tell.

Uncle Steven

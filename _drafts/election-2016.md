title: Election 2016
---

I used to hold the opinion that it wasn't worth spending a lot of time learning about candidates in the national election. I felt that if I was going to pay attention to the election, I would *really* want to pay attention and learn as much as I could about the candidates, but since I only had one vote, that seemed like a lot of work in order to make an extremely small impact on the election.

But I've come to realize that I can make a bigger impact that I originally thought. I can voice my opinions and potentially affect the vote of my friends and family, who could then affect the votes of other people. So over the last several months, I've *really* been paying attention to the national election. With only a couple months to go until Election Day, I felt that now was the right time for me to start trying to make an impact.

* The case for a major party (i.e. the case against staying home or voting third party)
* The case for Hillary Clinton
* The case against Donald Trump

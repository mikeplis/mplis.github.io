title: Election 2016

I used to hold the opinion that it wasn't worth spending a lot of time learning about candidates in the national election. I felt that if I was going to pay attention to the election, I would *really* want to pay attention and learn as much as I could about the candidates, but since I only had one vote, that seemed like a lot of work in order to make an extremely small impact on the election.

But I've come to realize that I can make a bigger impact that I originally thought. I can voice my opinions and potentially affect the vote of my friends and family, who could then affect the votes of other people. So over the last several months, I've *really* been paying attention to the national election. With only a couple months to go until Election Day, I felt that now was the right time for me to start trying to make an impact.

[Unlike Donald Trump](http://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13153832/donald-trump-refuse-to-concede), I will accept the results of the election even if they don't go the way I want them to, but I will do whatever little bit I can before the election to prevent him from winning.

    * Liar? - Not sure if this should be its own point

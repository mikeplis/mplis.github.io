title: What Is DeAndre Hopkins' 2015 Outlook?
---
DeAndre Hopkins is a rising star in fantasy football. He finished the 2014 season as the WR14 in both PPR and Standard formats. In redraft he's currently being drafted in the WR13-WR15 range and in dynasty, he's valued as roughly the WR11. He's an interesting case study due to the uncertainty around his quarterback situation and the departure of target-hog Andre Johnson, so I thought I'd look into the numbers to see what his outlook for the 2015 season might be.

Here's what we know (stats via ProFootballFocus):

* Hopkins was the WR14 (PPR and Standard) last season while getting 7.5 targets per game. He averaged 1.93 (PPR) and 1.3 (Standard) points per target.
* Andre Johnson and his 9.4 targets per game have left town.
* Houston brought in Cecil Shorts and Jaelen Strong at WR.
* Damaris Johnson was the only other Houston WR of note last season and he received about 2.9 targets per game.

Here are some assumptions:

* Houston's passing numbers will be about same in 2015 as they were in 2014. This roughly equates to per game numbers of 30 passes, 215 yards, and 1.3 TD's.
* The target numbers for Houston's non-WR pass catchers will stay about the same (RB's: 5, TE's: 3). This leaves 22 targets per game for the WR's.
* Most of Andre Johnson's and Damaris Johnson's targets will be distributed among Hopkins, Shorts, and Strong.

title: SFB360 Reaches and Steals

Now that all of the 2015 Scott Fish Bowl drafts are finished, I wanted to take a look at the results using the MyADP app to identify some of the biggest reaches and steals of the draft.

## Methodology

Identifying the best values is a subjective process. I looked at the players with the biggest absolute difference between where they were picked and what their ADP was, but I also looked at players with the biggest percent difference, since using just absolute difference would ignore some great values in the early rounds. Both measures tended to miss the best values in the middle rounds, so I chose to point out some reaches and steals in that range as well.

<!--I also tried to avoid players where their earliest pick and their latest pick were about the same distance from their ADP because those players tended to show up as both reaches and steals. For example, TJ Yeldon had an ADP of 53.1, with a high of 28 and a low of 80.-->

### Honorable Mentions


## Biggest Steals

It was tougher to find really great steals given the number of sharp drafters in these leagues. Good players rarely fell far, but there were still owners that got players much later than they typically went in these drafts.

### Adrian Peterson - Magnum

#### Owner: Dynasty Football Warehouse - Mike Krafick

#### Pick Number: 13

#### ADP: 4.3

Peterson was the player most frequently taken with the #1 overall pick, so Mike got a great deal getting Peterson at the top of the 2nd round.

### Andrew Luck - Boats N Hoes

### Russell Wilson - That Just Happened - Pick Number: 33, ADP: 17.6

### Drew Brees - That Just Happened - Pick Number: 54, ADP: 31.1

### Mark Ingram - Sex Panther - Pick Number: 62, ADP: 41.7

### T.J. Yeldon - Go Fast - Pick Number: 80, ADP: 53.1

### Alfred Morris - Glass Case - 45.4/70

### Todd Gurley - Go Fast - 58.8/92

### Rashad Jennings - Not First, You're Last - 97.6/137

### Eli Manning - Earmuffs - 56.8/82

### Joe Flacco - Shark Week - 74.4/112

### Tre Mason - Catalina Wine Mixer - 105.4/140

### Kevin White - Go Fast - 105.4/

### Marcus Mariota - That Just Happened

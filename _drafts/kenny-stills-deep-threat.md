title: Is Kenny Stills More Than Just A Deep Threat?
---
I've seen a bit of discussion lately about the Miami Dolphins revamped pass-catching corps as people try to figure out how targets are going to be distributed between Jarvis Landry, Kenny Stills, Devante Parker, Greg Jennings, and Jordan Cameron. In pretty much every discussion, I see Kenny Stills labeled as a "deep threat" or a "field stretcher".

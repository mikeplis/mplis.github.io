title: Kenny Stills Is More Than Just a Deep Threat
---
<!-- I've seen a bit of discussion lately about the Miami Dolphins revamped pass-catching corps as people try to figure out how targets are going to be distributed between Jarvis Landry, Kenny Stills, Devante Parker, Greg Jennings, and Jordan Cameron. In pretty much every discussion, I see Kenny Stills labeled as a "deep threat" or a "field stretcher". -->

<!-- When I hear "deep threat", I think of a player whose primary job is to run very fast far down the field. I think of a guy that regularly "takes the top of defenses". I consider players labeled as "deep threats" to be a little more limited in their ability to play the position, as opposed to a more complete receiver like Calvin Johnson. -->

When I hear "deep threat", I think of a complementary player. Obviously guys like Julio Jones and Calvin Johnson are threats to go deep on every play, but I hardly ever hear them called deep threats because I think that classification comes with the implication that that player isn't a complete receiver.

There has been a lot of discussion this offseason about the Miami Dolphins' revamped pass-catching corps as people try to figure out how targets are going to be distributed among Jarvis Landry, Kenny Stills, Devante Parker, Greg Jennings, and Jordan Cameron. In pretty much every discussion, I see Kenny Stills labeled as a "deep threat" or a "field stretcher" and I think people are selling him short.

Let's play a little game I like to call "Find the Deep Threats":

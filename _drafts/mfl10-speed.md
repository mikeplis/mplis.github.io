title: How Slow Is Your MFL10?
---
For the uninitiated, MFL10s are single-season, draft-only, best ball leagues run by MyFantasyLeague.com (more details can be found [here](http://www.myfantasyleague.com/mfl10s-draft-only-terms-of-service/)). They are a great alternative to standard mock drafts because participants have put up some money, so they're less likely to pull shenanigans like drafting a kicker with the first overall pick.

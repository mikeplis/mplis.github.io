title: How Are Receiving Stats Typically Distributed Among A Team's Pass Catchers?

This question popped into my head when people were discussing DeAndre Hopkins' value, specifically questioning his production given the uncertainty surrounding Houston's QB situation (depth chart at time of publishing: Ryan Mallett, Brian Hoyer, Tom Savage). My inclination was that Hopkins will likely put up pretty good numbers because [even bad passing offenses can produce startable WR's](http://dynastyleaguefootball.com/2014/04/29/take-a-pass/). This eventually led me to pose the question in the title of this post.

First of all, thank you for visiting my blog. Also, thank you for reading a post that you're proably not going to get much out of.

Right now, I'm planning to fill this blog with, among other things, data-driven posts about fantasy football. It's one of my favorite hobbies and I often find myself or others asking fantasy football questions that are best answered with data-driven research. Sometimes I'll do the research just to find the answer for myself or sometimes I'll post my findings in a forum or reddit thread.

But that feels like such a waste. I want to own the content that I create. I want to put it in a place where I and other people can easily find it. So that's what I'm doing. I'm creating a place where I can write about the things I care about. And hopefully I'm creating a place where people will read and discuss the things I write about the things I care about.

Lately I've been looking using start percentage data from MyFantasyLeague in my analyses. Start percentage data is useful because it's a pretty good proxy for a player's historical weekly ranking (which can be difficult to find). It incorporates his recent production, his opponent that week, and his health.

Combining this data with weekly fantasy scored yields some interesting insights. It can show how consistent a player was (or wasn't) and
